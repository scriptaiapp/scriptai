# Changelog

All notable changes to **Creator AI** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Versioning policy

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR** – breaking changes to public APIs, SDKs, DB schema, or user-facing contracts.
- **MINOR** – new features, non-breaking enhancements.
- **PATCH** – backwards-compatible bug fixes, perf, docs, chores.

The canonical version lives in the root [`package.json`](./package.json) and is mirrored in `apps/web` and `apps/api`. Every release gets a tag `vX.Y.Z` and a GitHub Release. The public-facing changelog page ([/changelog](https://tryscriptai.com/changelog)) is sourced from `apps/web/lib/changelog-data.ts` — keep it in sync with this file.

How to cut a release:

1. Update `apps/web/lib/changelog-data.ts` with the new release entry (top of the array).
2. Mirror the entry into this file under a new `## [X.Y.Z]` heading.
3. Bump versions in the root and app `package.json`s.
4. Commit: `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`.
5. Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags`.
6. Create a GitHub Release from the tag — paste the section from this file as the body.
